# GGJ2017
the GGD 2017 project

Game Developped under Unity during the GGJ 2017 at Paris.

This project is our interpretation of the map "LaneTowerDefense" from the Warcraft III custom maps. 
In a split screen, each player has to build towers to protect his base while sending units to destroy his opponent.

WARNING : you will need 2 XBox controller connected to your computer to make the game work correctly.
